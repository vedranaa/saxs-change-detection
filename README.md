Code for real-time SAXS change detection.

- `compute_change.py`, the initial data analysis script, may be executed in cells, exploratively.
- `visualize_folder_data.py`, tries visualizing all data in all folders 
- `data_navigator`, shows data in an interactive figure, where you use keyboard arrows to change the time. Has to be executed as a Python script.
